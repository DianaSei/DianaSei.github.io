<h1>Splitz project - my first project in Sketch</h1>


<p>This is where I started to think about changing my major. Before I've had the attempts in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects. However, I didn't take it seriously. Starting my first real project using Sketch as a basic software for UI design and adding or editing the specific elements in the programmes mentioned before have changed my mind to totally rethink my future. </p> 

<p> Splitz app became my first project in Sketch which after all I fell in love in the idea to bring new designs to the world. The project is not in the AppStore yet but the team is on the way to release it as soon as possible since it has the opportunities to become a really useful tool for everyone. </p>
