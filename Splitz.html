<h1 class="text-center h1 mb-3 font-weight-light" style="margin-top: 5%">Splitz project - my first project in Sketch</h1>


<p class="font-weight-light">This is where I started to think about changing my major. Before I've had the attempts in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects. However, I didn't take it seriously. Starting my first real project using Sketch as a basic software for UI design and adding or editing the specific elements in the programmes mentioned before have changed my mind to totally rethink my future. </p> 

<p class="font-weight-light"> Splitz app became my first project in Sketch which after all I fell in love in the idea to bring new designs to the world. The project is not in the AppStore yet but the team is on the way to release it as soon as possible since it has the opportunities to become a really useful tool for everyone. </p>

<p class="font-weight-light"> The app is an utility for young people who always hang out with friends and end up paying and spliting the bills. Splitz will keep all the receipts and divide it equally or per meal between the friends. Moreover, now they don't need to remind each other to pay back, the app will do it for them.</p><br/>

<p class="font-weight-light"> To make an app everyday utility we add the feature like "Invoices" which will help the businessmen or people who like to monitor what they spend their money for to manage their expenses every month. </p> <br/>

<p class="font-weight-light"> In terms of designing I faced a lot of challenges as a fresh self-learner. First of all, the picture in my head didn't tally with what I could get on the screen. Secondly, all the details in designing like colors, combinations, how to make the original pictire look good and modern, how to provide a certain level of UI design, etc were learned through articles and videos. Thirdly, we aim to make the app as easy understandable as we can to make it user friendly and simply navigated. Fourthly, the design should be satisfying for every member of the team and future potential investors.</p>
<p class="font-weight-light">Since the project is still in a progress and not released in AppStore not all the screenshots are shown here. </p>
